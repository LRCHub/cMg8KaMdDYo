Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away, everybody say right here
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away, here we go
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, little sister let me hear you play
Just a few more weary days and then
Let me hear it, I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, one more time real loud
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away, big finish
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
