[00:13.06] Come and fly away with me
[00:16.25] Come and fly away with me
[00:19.69] Come and fly away with me
[00:22.32] Co-co-come and fly away with me
[00:37.82] 
[00:25.96] Come and fly away with me
[00:29.17] Come and fly away with me
[00:32.45] Come and fly away with me
[00:35.26] Co-co-come and fly away with me
[00:50.76] 
[00:38.90] Don't you be afraid, everything will change
[00:41.67] You and I, jumping off the edge
[00:43.43] They say dreamers never die
[00:45.00] So, come and fly, come and fly
[00:47.17] Come and fly away with me
[00:59.67] 
[00:52.15] We're rising, we're falling
[00:55.52] We'll make it through
[00:58.70] We're climbing, we're soaring
[01:02.05] A thousand views
[01:10.05] 
[01:05.31] We're rising, we're falling
[01:08.47] We'll make it through
[01:11.61] We're climbing, we're soaring
[01:15.06] A thousand views
[01:23.06] 
[01:34.18] Somewhere by the emerald sea
[01:37.39] Where the moon and water meet
[01:40.47] Somewhere close to harmony
[01:43.70] When the world is sound asleep
[01:58.70] 
[01:47.03] Something's gonna bring the change
[01:50.21] Journeys we are meant to take
[01:53.51] Something at the edge of space
[01:56.78] Calling us to fly away
[02:07.78] 
[02:00.00] Don't you be afraid, everything will change
[02:02.75] You and I, jumping off the edge
[02:04.55] They say dreamers never die
[02:06.15] So, come and fly, come and fly
[02:08.15] Come and fly away with me
[02:20.65] 
[02:13.38] We're rising, we're falling
[02:16.62] We'll make it through
[02:19.92] We're climbing, we're soaring
[02:23.03] A thousand views
[02:31.03] 
[02:26.49] We're rising, we're falling
[02:29.53] We'll make it through
[02:32.70] We're climbing, we're soaring
[02:36.12] A thousand views
[02:44.12] 
[02:39.03] Come and fly away
[02:40.18] Come and, come and fly away
[02:42.07] Come and fly away with me
[02:54.57] 
[02:45.45] Come and fly away
[02:46.69] Come and, come and fly away
[02:48.73] Come and fly away with me
[03:01.23] 
[02:55.17] Something's gonna bring the change
[02:58.46] Journeys we are meant to take
[03:01.65] Something at the edge of space
[03:04.83] Calling us to fly away
